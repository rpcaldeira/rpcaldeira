### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ glad to see you here! My name is Rui :boy: and welcome to my space (not MySpace)!
### I'm from Lisbon, Portugal and I currently work at <a href="https://www.infinera.com"><img src="https://www.infinera.com/wp-content/uploads/logo-header.png.webp" alt="Infinera Logo" width="75"/></a> as a Java developer.

I love developing software (mostly backend) because we have the possibility to create what we want without having to wait for other to do it for you, complementing that I also have a sweet spot for System Administration and Software Security to try and have a sense of that exists and what is being done.

My current learning focuses are Docker, Azure, Gradle and CI/CD

If anything here tickles your fancy feel free to use it but please pay-it-forward by publishing the changes in a open-souce repository so the work can continue!

Have fun, #StaySafe and happy coding
